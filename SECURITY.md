## Security Policy

### Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the actively maintained branch of DOaaS. Older releases receive fixes only when the backport effort is low and the issue is high severity.

| Version        | Status                |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| `main` branch  | Actively supported    |
| Older releases | Best effort (upgrade) |

If you are running an older commit or a fork and cannot upgrade, please highlight that in your report so we can discuss options.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not open a public GitHub issue or discussion** for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, use one of the following private channels:

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: https://github.com/samerfarida/doaas/security/advisories/new
- **Email**: `samer.farida@yahoo.com`

When reporting, please include as much detail as possible:

- Proof-of-concept or reproduction steps
- Affected commit SHA or release tag
- Impact assessment and suggested mitigations, if known
- Preferred contact information and availability

If you require encryption, mention it in your report and we can provide an OpenPGP key over email.

### What Happens Next

- **Acknowledgement**: We aim to acknowledge receipt within **2 business days**.
- **Initial assessment**: We will triage and respond with initial findings or questions within **5 business days**.
- **Remediation plan**: For confirmed issues, we will coordinate on a fix, testing, and target release timeline. We may request additional information to reproduce or validate the issue.
- **Coordinated disclosure**: We prefer coordinated disclosure so users can patch before details are public. We will agree on a disclosure window (typically 30–90 days, depending on severity) and keep you updated on progress.

If you believe a vulnerability is being actively exploited or needs immediate attention, please mark your report as **URGENT** and include a reachable contact method.

### Safe Harbor

We value legitimate security research. When you follow this policy and report issues responsibly, we will not pursue legal action or DMCA claims against you. Please:

- Avoid privacy violations, service degradation, or destruction of data
- Respect rate limits and always obtain consent before testing on systems you do not own

Thank you for helping keep DOaaS and its users safe.
